It requires regular practice to regulate your <br>thoughts, identify your rigid attitudes and demands on self, and world. <br> Depression is an emotional disorder, and your emotions are outcome of what <br> you think and how you speaking to yourself in the adverse situation. <br>

                  <p style="font-size: 19.5px;">1. Hygiene is Self Care: <br><br>
Not following hygiene is a form of self neglect. Not keeping clean, wearing <br> soiled clothes, poor grooming impacts the over all mood. Think about days <br> from your past when you were well groomed and the confidence you carried. <br> Consciously taking care of your hygiene is the first step towards your physical <br> and mental health. Don't give your self any excuse to escape hygiene.</p>

           <br>  <p style="font-size: 19.5px;">2. "Say no Sedentary Life" <br><br>
Go for morning or evening walks. Exercising releases happy hormones and neurotransmitters like Oxytocin, Serotonin and Endorphins which are our <br> body's  natural pain relivers and will make you feel happy, restful, confident and energetic.</p>

       <br> <p style="font-size: 19.5px;">3. "Perspective Taking" <br> <br>
            We often think to ourselves "This is worst to happen to me" "This is unbearable". <br> We humans often have a tendency to think in extreme when we really desire <br> something or when something bad happens. But we often fail to understand <br> the difference between bad and the worst and use them interchangeably. Ask <br> yourself, "Is this the first that can happen?" definitely not!</p>

</div>
<p style="font-size: 19.5px;">Know that you are not the only one going through the adversity, there are many people around the corners of the world facing even more worse situation <br> than you, and they are still persisting and sticking through themselves. Remember the saying: “There is no time like The Present” This is in your hand and you  can handle.</p>

        Man is a social animal. We tend to work, live and perform better around <br> people. Several researches have confirmed that making healthy connections <br> helps relieving stress, increase our survival, decrease the chances of illnesses. <br> In one of the articles by Holt-Lunstad and colleagues it was stated that high <br> social connections and interactions are related to low death rates and low <br> social interactions is said to be twice risky that obesity.</p>

          <br><br> <p style="font-size: 19.5px;">5. "Evaluate your Self-talks" <br><br>
            Evaluate and reflect upon the way you think and talk to yourself about life <br> situations. Be aware of the content of your thought process. About your self <br> talk, ask is it practical? Is it realistic? Is it logical? Can I prove it with evidences? <br> Write down your thoughts, and read it out loud, it will bring more sense.</p>

           <br> <br> <p style="font-size: 19.5px;">6. "Label Jars not Humans" <br>
            We are conditioned to associate our worth based on whether we are doin well as per societal expectations. In this rat race when you compare your failings <br> with others also learn to look at your progress, because you are a combination of both your fall and rise. In this process do not call your self "loser" <br>"failure"  "less" "incapable", because we humans are complex process and  not a static thing to be labeled. When you label yourself, you are being <br> judgmental and  dogmatic. Practice Unconditional acceptance</p>

            When you want to be understood, communicate about your thoughts to your <br> loved ones. If you want to seek help, want a favor or have any expectations <br> from others don't assume they should understand without you speaking to <br> them, you are dealing with a human and not a God!</p>

            In spite of trying the above, if it doesn't help, reach out to the near Psychologist / Psychiatrist. Don't judge yourself to seek help regarding your mental <br> health because you wouldn't judge yourself for seeking help for your physical health.</p>
